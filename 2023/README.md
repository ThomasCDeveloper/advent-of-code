# 2023: the year of Golang

## How to use

Put your input as `xx.input` in the input folder (for example, for the first day I suggest naming _./inputs/01.input_).

Then go to `./main.go` and update the code to use the corresponding package.

## How to code

When starting a new day, copy/paste `./XX` and change its name (and package) to the corresponding day.

Edit `./newXX/main.go`.

You shall create files like `./inputs/01.input.test` or `./inputs/01b.input.test` if need be.

## Thoughts on Go

I really dig Go. Its syntax is very simple and quick to learn, and it provides fantastics results. I particularly like the "poor" (some might say essential) standard library, as it made me code almost everything, and I think it is a very good entry point as a software engineer.

I don't believe Go is the best language to tackle advent of code, as its error handling system might be quite annoying at times for this kind of cases where you _know_ that everything would go right. But for production software, one would guess it would be amazing.

## Thoughts on 2023 advent of code

| Day | Difficulty | Comment |
|----|----|----|
| 01 | Easy | Easy but quite _difficult_ for a first day, I would say |
| 02 | Easy | Easier than day 1 |

## Notes

./old is the code from my first attempt. Bad bad code. Please don't look inside.
