| --- | ------ | ----------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------- |
| 01  | 2/2    | Easy enough | Easy enough but quite hard for a Day 01                                                                                                                                       | 28.8 ms ± 2.9 ms    |
| 02  | 2/2    | Easy        | Easy but not so elegant solution                                                                                                                                              | 587.7 ms ± 7.8 ms   |
| 03  | 2/2    | Easy        | Easiest of the 3 firsts I think                                                                                                                                               | 47.7 ms ± 4.4 ms    |
| 04  | 2/2    | Easy        | Easy, good for practice                                                                                                                                                       | 320.8 ms ± 7.8 ms   |
| 05  | 2/2    | Mild        | P1 almost trivial, P2 can be hard I think if we do not find a trick                                                                                                           | 24.6 ms ± 2.7 ms    |
| 06  | 2/2    | Easy        | A bit headscratcher but easy still                                                                                                                                            | 29.7 ms ± 3.3 ms    |
| 07  | 2/2    | Mild        | I tried to anticipate P2 during P1 and made my work harder (for someone who doesn't try to be smart it is an easy problem)                                                    | 29.9 ms ± 3.6 ms    |
| 08  | 2/2    | Hard        | Truly the first hard problem. Even P1 is not easy and my P2 is painfully slow                                                                                                 | 62.083 s ± 2.982 s  |
| 09  | 2/2    | Mild        | Not very hard but probably highly optimizable                                                                                                                                 | 2.818 s ± 0.031 s   |
| 10  | 2/2    | Hard        | Very hard, but also very interesting problem (probably the most interesting one this year)                                                                                    | 145.516 s ± 2.771 s |
| 11  | 2/2    | Mild        | Not very hard, nice problem                                                                                                                                                   | 21.0 ms ± 2.3 ms    |
| 12  | 2/2    | ???         | Got a working solution, but can't prove it would be working for every input... Both sad and relieved that there's a trick to this otherwise very hard and interesting problem | 21.6 ms ± 2.8 ms    |
