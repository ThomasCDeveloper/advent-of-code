| --- | ------ | ----------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------ |
| 01  | 2/2    | Easy enough | Easy enough but quite hard for a Day 01                                                                                    | 28.8 ms ± 2.9 ms   |
| 02  | 2/2    | Easy        | Easy but not so elegant solution                                                                                           | 587.7 ms ± 7.8 ms  |
| 03  | 2/2    | Easy        | Easiest of the 3 firsts I think                                                                                            | 47.7 ms ± 4.4 ms   |
| 04  | 2/2    | Easy        | Easy, good for practice                                                                                                    | 320.8 ms ± 7.8 ms  |
| 05  | 2/2    | Mild        | P1 almost trivial, P2 can be hard I think if we do not find a trick                                                        | 24.6 ms ± 2.7 ms   |
| 06  | 2/2    | Easy        | A bit headscratcher but easy still                                                                                         | 29.7 ms ± 3.3 ms   |
| 07  | 2/2    | Mild        | I tried to anticipate P2 during P1 and made my work harder (for someone who doesn't try to be smart it is an easy problem) | 29.9 ms ± 3.6 ms   |
| 08  | 2/2    | Hard        | Truly the first hard problem. Even P1 is not easy and my P2 is painfully slow                                              | 62.083 s ± 2.982 s |
| 09  | 2/2    | Mild        | Not very hard but probably highly optimizable                                                                              | 2.818 s ± 0.031 s  |
| 10  |        |             |                                                                                                                            |                    |
| 11  |        |             |                                                                                                                            |                    |
| 12  |        |             |                                                                                                                            |                    |
